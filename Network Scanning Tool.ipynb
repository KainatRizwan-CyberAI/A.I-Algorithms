    "Overview\n",
    "========\n",
    "The code is designed to perform network scanning and port scanning. It discovers devices on a specified network and identifies open ports on these devices. The code uses two primary libraries: Scapy for network scanning and Socket for port scanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions\n",
    "=========\n",
    "scan_network(ip_range)\n",
    "=\n",
    "Purpose: This function discovers active devices on the network by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests.\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "ip_range: A string representing the range of IP addresses to scan (e.g., \"192.168.1.1/24\").\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "Create ARP Request: An ARP request is crafted with the destination IP range to find devices.\n",
    "Create Broadcast Frame: An Ethernet frame with a broadcast MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) is created to send the ARP request to all devices on the local network.\n",
    "Send and Receive Packets: The ARP request packet is sent out, and responses are collected. The srp function from Scapy handles sending and receiving packets.\n",
    "Process Responses: The function processes the responses to extract the IP and MAC addresses of the devices that replied.\n",
    "Return Results: A list of dictionaries is returned, each containing the IP and MAC addresses of a detected device.\n",
    "scan_ports(ip)\n",
    "=\n",
    "Purpose: This function checks for open ports on a specified IP address.\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "ip: A string representing the IP address of the device to scan.\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "Scan Ports: The function iterates through a range of common ports (1 to 1024).\n",
    "Create Socket: For each port, a new socket is created and connected to the IP address and port.\n",
    "Check Port Status: The connect_ex method is used to try connecting to the port. If the connection is successful (result is 0), the port is considered open.\n",
    "Close Socket: After each check, the socket is closed to free resources.\n",
    "Return Results: A list of open ports is returned.\n",
    "main()\n",
    "=\n",
    "Purpose: This function coordinates the network and port scanning processes.\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "Define IP Range: Specifies the network range to scan.\n",
    "Scan Network: Calls scan_network to discover devices on the network.\n",
    "Print Device Information: Prints the IP and MAC addresses of detected devices.\n",
    "Scan Ports for Each Device: Calls scan_ports for each detected device to find open ports and prints the results.\n",
    "Execution: The main function is executed if the script is run directly (if __name__ == \"__main__\":).\n",
    "Execution\n",
    "Network Scanning: The scan_network function detects devices on the network by sending ARP requests and processing the responses.\n",
    "Port Scanning: The scan_ports function checks for open ports on each detected device by attempting connections to common ports.\n",
    "Results: The detected devices and their open ports are printed to the console.\n",
    "This code provides a basic yet effective way to scan a network and identify open ports, which can be useful for network administration, security assessments, or troubleshooting."
