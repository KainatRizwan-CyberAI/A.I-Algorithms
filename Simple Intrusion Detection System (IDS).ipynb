    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "The IDS is a system designed to monitor network traffic and detect unusual or potentially malicious activities. The code starts with a brief introduction explaining the concept of IDS and common detection techniques, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Signature-Based Detection: Identifies threats using predefined patterns.\n",
    "Anomaly-Based Detection: Detects deviations from normal network behavior.\n",
    "Hybrid Detection: Combines both signature and anomaly-based methods.\n",
    "2. Capture Network Traffic\n",
    "The capture_traffic function uses the Scapy library to capture network packets for a specified duration. By default, it captures packets for 30 seconds. The captured packets are returned for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preprocess Data\n",
    "The preprocess_data function converts the captured packets into a Pandas DataFrame. For each packet, the function extracts relevant information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time: When the packet was captured.\n",
    "Source IP: The IP address from which the packet originated.\n",
    "Destination IP: The IP address to which the packet is sent.\n",
    "Protocol: The protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP).\n",
    "Length: The size of the packet in bytes.\n",
    "4. Implement Detection\n",
    "The detect_anomalies function performs a simple rule-based anomaly detection. It flags packets with a length greater than 1000 bytes as potential anomalies. This is a basic method to illustrate anomaly detection but may not be effective for complex attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Visualize Data\n",
    "The visualize_data function uses Matplotlib to create two plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "Network Traffic Length Over Time: This plot shows the length of network packets over time, allowing you to see the general traffic pattern.\n",
    "Detected Anomalies: This plot highlights the packets identified as anomalies, showing their length and capture time.\n",
    "6. Limitations and Improvements\n",
    "The code concludes with a discussion on the limitations of the simple IDS implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Detection: The rule-based approach may not detect sophisticated attacks or new threats.\n",
    "False Positives: Strict rules might lead to false positives, where legitimate traffic is flagged as anomalies.\n",
    "Scope: The current system only detects specific types of anomalies.\n",
    "Potential improvements suggested include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning-Based Detection: Incorporate machine learning techniques for better detection accuracy.\n",
    "Complex Rules: Develop more complex detection rules to improve detection capabilities.\n",
    "Efficiency: Enhance the system to handle larger volumes of traffic effectively.\n",
    "This explanation covers the main components and functionality of the IDS code, providing a clear understanding of its operation and limitations."
